        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am Dani, a game developer from Argentina &#127462;&#127479;</p>
        <p>In this website I'll be posting my newest projects and games releasing, and also maybe some games you can play in the browser.</p>
        <h3>Let me introduce  me a little better...</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was a kid I loved playing videogames, in fact, my first memories are playing the rambo game for the sega genesis.</p>
        <p>As I grew up, I started to be interested in how games were made, and when my parents installed internet in the house one of the first things I searched was 'How to make videogames'.</p>
        <p>And thats how I met Unity, yep, I started with unity... 4? I can't really remember the version right now but it was back in 2012 (yes, we didn't have internet until then because we live in a small town and there wasn't any ISP LOL)</p>
        <p>My first games were good? of course no, they looked and played as if a drug addict played doom and tried to make a videogame just from what he remembered.</p>
        <p>But I kept learning and changed from Unity (the indie classic), CryEngine 3 (One of the most graphicly impressive engines), to Unreal Engine 3 (UDK back then and it used to be pretty awesome and run pretty good too) where I would fall in love with Environment designs and finally would become and have my first job in the industry as a 3D Environment Artist when I was just 16yo.</p>
        <p>After that I would work in a few more jobs as a 3D Environment Artist but mostly as a programmer in Unity.</p>
        <p>Now I'm 22yo and trying to find my foot in the industry with my next game, a dark boomer shooter inspired in gameplay by killing floor and rogue-like games.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading this far, I hope you like my games and projects!</p>
        <p>Feel free to contact me if you want to collab or just say hi!</p>
        <p>Cheers!</p>
        <p>Dani</p>
